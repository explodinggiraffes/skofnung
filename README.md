Skofnung
=====

Skofnung is an application that uses [Ogre](https://www.ogre3d.org/) as its rendering engine. It demonstrates how to load meshes, create MeshPtr objects, and set up a basic camera and lighting.

You can use README - `Skofnung project properties.txt` for ideas on how you might want

Note: Skofnung has its VS solution and project files in different directories for flexibility (e.g., we want the Skofnung solution to encompass different projects that all rely upon the libraries in `extern`.) There is nothing specific to Ogre demanding this structure.
